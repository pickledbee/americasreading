    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This comprehensive report examines literacy levels in America's public schools over the past 25 years by reviewing reading, spelling, and comprehension data. Drawing on national assessments, state reports, and research studies, the infographic highlights performance trends, the impact of COVID-19, demographic challenges, and initiatives aimed at improving literacy.

    <h2>Reading Performance Trends</h2>
    <h3>NAEP Results</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Fourth-grade reading scores in 2022 are lower than in over 20 years.</li>
      <li>Eighth-grade scores have reached a 30-year low.</li>
      <li>Both grades dropped by 3 points from 2019 to 2022.</li>
      <li>Lower percentiles (10th, 25th, 50th, and 75th) experienced declines, while the 90th percentile remained steady.</li>
      <li>The decline follows a decade of stagnation, with scores beginning to drop in 2019.</li>
    </ul>

    </div>

    <h3>State-Level Data</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Most states showed declines in both fourth- and eighth-grade reading scores between 2019 and 2022.</li>
      <li>Thirty states recorded significant drops for fourth graders and 33 for eighth graders.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact of COVID-19</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Remote learning challenges, reduced resource access, and diminished teacher–peer interaction worsened literacy outcomes.</li>
      <li>Higher-income districts recovered faster than lower-income ones.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Long-Term Trends</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Pre-pandemic improvements in reading for 9- and 13-year-olds (1970s–2020) have been partially reversed.</li>
      <li>Mathematics scores have improved at twice the rate of reading scores over the past 50 years.</li>
      <li>Early reading struggles strongly predict high school dropout rates (9 out of 10 dropouts were struggling readers in third grade).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="infographic-section">
    <h2>Spelling Performance Trends</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Research indicates that while passage comprehension growth remains steady from first through fourth grade, spelling scores drop dramatically by third grade and continue declining.</li>
      <li>Spelling remains important even in high school despite increased use of technology like spell checkers.</li>
      <li>Debate continues over the need for traditional spelling instruction versus technology-based assistance.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="infographic-section">
    <h2>Comprehension Performance Trends</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The 2022 NAEP Long-Term Trend for nine-year-olds shows reading comprehension scores not seen since 1999.</li>
      <li>International assessments (PISA) indicate that U.S. students have stagnated in Global Literacy Rankings since 2000.</li>
      <li>Strong background knowledge and metacognitive skills are crucial for understanding texts.</li>
      <li>Cooperative learning has proven effective in teaching comprehension strategies.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="infographic-section">
    <h2>Demographics of Struggling Students</h2>
    <h3>Reading</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Over 60% of students are below grade level in reading (2019 Nation's Report Card).</li>
      <li>Approximately 43 million U.S. adults have low literacy skills.</li>
      <li>Limited parent–child literacy engagement significantly impacts early literacy.</li>
      <li>Between 46% and 51% of American adults live well below the poverty level due to low literacy.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Spelling</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>70–80% of individuals with limited reading proficiency suffer from dyslexia.</li>
      <li>About 20% of U.S. school children have dyslexia, highlighting the need for early support.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Comprehension</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Students who are African American, Hispanic, English learners, or from low-income households face disproportionately high rates (60–70%) of weak reading skills.</li>
      <li>A long history of denying access to reading has contributed to persistent disparities.</li>
      <li>Globally, nearly 781 million adults (mostly female) lack basic literacy skills.</li>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      The past 25 years reveal both progress and challenges in literacy education. While earlier decades showed gradual improvements in reading and comprehension, recent data—further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic—demonstrates alarming declines. Addressing this literacy crisis is a societal imperative. Evidence-based interventions, targeted support for diverse learners, enhanced teacher training, and family engagement are essential to empower every student with the literacy skills needed for success in the 21st century.
